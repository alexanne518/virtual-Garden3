# Virtual Garden

### A website written in Java, users can simulate growing and taking care of a plant with our virtual garden.

This project was made for a partner project in java OOP class, to desmostraight our skills and knowledge in java.

Users can:
  * log in/sign up
  * pick which plant they would like to grow (only african violet optional for now)
  * water, feed and fertilize the plant to improve it's stats and see them on the top left

Future improvements:
  * implement more plant options (cactus, and orchid)
